# Pre-school Experience

## Challenges in Singaporean Early Education

In the bustling urban environment of Singapore, preschools face unique constraints that can limit a child's natural development:

- Many children are limited to only 1-2 hours of outdoor play per day.
- Lack of space means many urban preschools have little to no outdoor playground area for motor skill development.
- Limited Nature Exposure (animals, insects, farming etc.)

## Program Benefits - A Bridge Between Two Cultures

### For Singaporean Students

- **Cultural Discovery**: Experience authentic Japanese traditions and acquire basic Japanese language skills.
- **Holistic Development**: Enhance motor and social skills through extended outdoor play and meaningful interaction with local Japanese peers.
- **Nature Immersion**: Step away from the city and into the breathtaking rural landscapes of Kumamoto.

### For Japanese Students

- **Global Communication**: Practice foundational English through natural play and learn about diverse cultures from Singaporean visitors.
- **Global Mindset**: Cultivate an early worldview and appreciation for international diversity.
- **Lasting Connections**: Create the spark for lifelong international friendships.
